		<h3>Twin Cities Bicycle Fix-It Station Map</h3>

<p style="align:left;">I made this map because I realized one didn't exist until now. I was an avid bike commuter (thanks, COVID-19) and I forgetting my tools just in case I needed to fix my bike and couldn't take it to a bike shop. To gather the locations, I biked around Minneapolis and sent <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13" target="_blank">Public Records Requests</a> to every park, school, city, and county in the Twin Cities.</a></p>

<p style="align:left;">The map is still a work in progress because either I haven't gotten around to inspecting the fix-it stations that the entities have informed me of, or they haven't gotten back to me. If you notice anything off, send me an e-mail.</p>

<p style="align:left;">Donations appreciated, because you should feel bad that a laid-off person of color biked around the Twin Cities to get this data for you so you can know where to get your bike fixed. E-mail me for my Paypal.</p>
